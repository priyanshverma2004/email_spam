📧 Email Spam ClassifierThis project is a machine learning implementation of an Email Spam Classifier that uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to distinguish between legitimate emails (ham) and unwanted junk emails (spam).
🚀 FeaturesData Preprocessing: Loads and prepares the email dataset.Text Vectorization: Converts raw email text into a numerical format suitable for machine learning using the Bag-of-Words model via CountVectorizer.Model Training: Trains a robust Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is highly effective for text classification tasks.Model Evaluation: Calculates and reports key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
💻 PrerequisitesTo run this project, you need Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:pandasscikit-learn (sklearn)jupyter (for running the notebook)You can install the necessary packages using pip:Bashpip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter
