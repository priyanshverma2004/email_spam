This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham). By applying data preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and supervised learning algorithms, the model learns to detect patterns in email text and metadata that distinguish unwanted spam from useful communication. The system enhances email security, reduces inbox clutter, and improves user productivity by automatically filtering malicious or irrelevant messages.
